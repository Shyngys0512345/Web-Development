        <h1>Through Windless Night The Glinting Moon</h1>
        <p>
            Through windless night the glinting moon<br>
            Illuminates in flowing waves<br>
            The village nestled in the vale<br>
            Where crests the overflowing stream<br>
            <br>
            The thick-trunked, bare-branched tree<br>
            speaks in whispers to itself--<br>
            don't you see the bustling earth<br>
            Turning its face green again?<br>
        </p>
